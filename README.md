# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a DataFrame by city type, then use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will then use this analysis to make a recommendation to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the different types of cities.

## Summary

Our summary shows that Urban cities have the highest number of Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares. However, Rural cities had the highest Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. Suburban cities were in the middle of both urban and rural in all metrics evaluated. 

Using the data, we have come up with three recommendations to the PyBer CEO for improving the business and maximizing profits.

1. Increase marketing and exposure to the rural cities.
    - The average fare for a ride in the rural city type is 41% higher than the urban city type. This is likely due to the distance driven between locations being larger. Increasing advertising in the rural space can potentially make rural cities a larger profit engine while using fewer resources. 
    - The average fare for a rural driver is 335% higher so the drivers will make more money, which will strengthen the workforce.

2. Adjust the ratio of fare cost and number of drivers in the Urban cities.
    - The average fare per driver is not proportional to the average fare per ride when compared rural to urban areas. 
    - Reducing the amount of drivers and raising the fare cost for urban cities will increase profits, and the drivers will be making more as well which will strengthen the retention of quality drivers. 
    - Removing drivers from urban cities should not affect profits negatively, since there are already MANY more drivers than rides given in this city type.

3. Consider having special promotions or 'sales' in the suburban market.
    - When compared to rural and urban city types, the Suburban cities peaked in late February and never really returned to that level of profit after that. This means the potential for increased suburban activity is not being met.
    - Having promotions when the ride counts are low in suburban cities will help keep that market profitable and hopefully create a stronger dependency on PyBer in the long run.
